# Working with Data

Node's APIs give us access to the file system, which means we can manipulate data!

Take a look at https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_readfile_file_options_callback

## 🙋 Name Picker!

Work with the filesystem to read in the data in `students.txt`
Return a random student's name.

# Bonus 

## 👯‍Random Pairs

Read in the data from `students.txt` and return groups of two.
If there's an odd number create a group of 3.

## 👩‍ Weekly Checkins

Read in the data from `students.txt` and create a Weekly Check-in file.

Instructors should meet with 4 students a day.  Display each day of the week followed by 4 students nams.

Save the file as `checkins.md`
